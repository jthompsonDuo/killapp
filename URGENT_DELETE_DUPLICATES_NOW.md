# 🚨 CRITICAL: You STILL Have Duplicate Files!

## ⚠️ You're Running The Wrong App.tsx!

Your `/src/App.tsx` has the correct grid layout:
```jsx
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4 gap-6">
```

But you have a **duplicate** `App.tsx` at root level that probably doesn't have this grid!

## 🗑️ DELETE These Root Files NOW:

```bash
# Run these commands in your project root:
rm App.tsx                    # ❌ DELETE
rm main.tsx                   # ❌ DELETE  
rm -rf components/            # ❌ DELETE entire folder
rm -rf services/              # ❌ DELETE entire folder
rm -rf styles/                # ❌ DELETE entire folder
```

## ✅ Keep Only These:
- `src/App.tsx` ✅ (has correct grid layout)
- `src/main.tsx` ✅
- `src/components/` ✅
- `src/services/` ✅
- `src/styles/` ✅
- All root config files ✅

## 🔧 After Deleting Duplicates:
1. **Restart your dev server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Cards will display in proper grid!** 🎉
3. **Push to GitHub for clean deployment**

## Why This Fixes It:
- Your `index.html` points to `/src/main.tsx` 
- But duplicate `main.tsx` at root confuses the bundler
- It loads wrong `App.tsx` without grid styles
- Delete duplicates = correct files load = grid works! ✅
