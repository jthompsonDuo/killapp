# üîç Debug Your Hardcoded Google Sheets URL

## Current Status:
Your `/App.tsx` imports from `/services/google-sheets-tracker.ts` (ROOT level) ‚úÖ

## To Set Your Hardcoded URL:

1. **Open `/services/google-sheets-tracker.ts`** (ROOT level, not `/src/services/`)

2. **Find line 11** and replace:
   ```typescript
   private scriptUrl: string = 'https://script.google.com/macros/s/YOUR_ACTUAL_SCRIPT_ID_HERE/exec';
   ```

3. **Replace `YOUR_ACTUAL_SCRIPT_ID_HERE`** with your real Google Apps Script ID

   Example:
   ```typescript
   private scriptUrl: string = 'https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbzXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/exec';
   ```

## Test If It's Working:

1. **Open browser console** (F12 ‚Üí Console)
2. **Click a card** with "Google Sheets" tracking selected
3. **Look for this log:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Data sent to Google Sheets: {timestamp: "...", action: "kill", ...}
   ```

## Debug Commands:
Add this to your browser console to check the current URL:
```javascript
// Check what URL is currently set
console.log('Current Google Sheets URL:', window.googleSheetsTracker?.getScriptUrl());
```

## Your File Structure Issue:
üö® **You STILL have duplicate files!** 
- `/services/google-sheets-tracker.ts` ‚úÖ (this is what App.tsx uses)
- `/src/services/google-sheets-tracker.ts` ‚ùå (not used, can be deleted)

## Quick Fix:
1. Update `/services/google-sheets-tracker.ts` line 11 with your real Script ID
2. Delete all `/src/` duplicates:
   ```bash
   rm -rf src/
   ```
3. Test by clicking cards with Google Sheets tracking enabled

**Your app will start working immediately after you put your real Script ID in line 11!** üéâ
