# üéØ EXACTLY Where to Hardcode Your Google Sheets URL

## ‚úÖ The Correct File:
**Your App.tsx imports from:** `/services/google-sheets-tracker.ts` (ROOT level)

## üî• What to Change:
**Open:** `/services/google-sheets-tracker.ts` (ROOT level, NOT `/src/services/`)
**Edit line 11:** Replace `YOUR_ACTUAL_SCRIPT_ID_HERE` with your real Script ID

### Before:
```typescript
private scriptUrl: string = 'https://script.google.com/macros/s/YOUR_ACTUAL_SCRIPT_ID_HERE/exec';
```

### After (example):
```typescript
private scriptUrl: string = 'https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbzXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/exec';
```

## üîç How to Get Your Script ID:
1. Open your Google Apps Script project
2. Copy the URL: `https://script.google.com/d/1ABC123DEF456/edit`
3. The Script ID is: `1ABC123DEF456` (between `/d/` and `/edit`)
4. Your deployment URL: `https://script.google.com/macros/s/1ABC123DEF456/exec`

## üß™ Test It:
1. Save the file after editing line 11
2. Refresh your app
3. Open browser console (F12 ‚Üí Console)
4. Click "Google Sheets" tracking method
5. Click a card
6. Look for: `‚úÖ Data sent to Google Sheets:` in console

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistake:
Don't edit `/src/services/google-sheets-tracker.ts` - that's the duplicate file that's NOT being used!

**Your app is ready to work as soon as you put your real Script ID in line 11!** üéâ
