# ðŸš€ Netlify Deployment Guide

Your site failed to load because browsers can't run TypeScript directly. Here are **3 ways to fix this**:

## âœ… Solution 1: Use GitHub (Recommended)

1. **Push your code to GitHub:**
   - Create a new repository on GitHub
   - Upload all your files there
   
2. **Connect to Netlify:**
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Click "Add new site" â†’ "Import an existing project"
   - Connect your GitHub repo
   - Build settings will be detected automatically:
     - Build command: `npm run build`
     - Publish directory: `dist`
   - Click "Deploy site"

3. **Done!** Netlify will build and deploy automatically.

## âœ… Solution 2: Build Locally Then Upload

1. **Install Node.js** on your computer if you haven't
2. **Open terminal in your project folder**
3. **Run these commands:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```
4. **Upload the `dist` folder** to Netlify (drag & drop just the `dist` folder)

## âœ… Solution 3: Quick Fix - Use This Ready-to-Deploy Version

I've restructured your project to work better with Netlify. Here's what changed:

### File Structure Changes:
- Moved all source files to `/src/` folder
- Updated `index.html` to point to `/src/main.tsx`
- All imports now use proper `src/` paths

### What You Need to Do:
1. **Download this updated code**
2. **Follow Solution 1 or 2 above**

## ðŸ”§ Common Issues & Fixes

**"Module not found" errors:**
- Make sure all your files are in the correct folders
- Check that import paths start with `./` for relative imports

**"Build failed" on Netlify:**
- Check that `package.json` has all dependencies
- Ensure Node.js version is compatible (we use v18+)

**Tailwind styles not working:**
- Make sure `globals.css` is imported in `main.tsx`
- Check that Tailwind config is correct

## ðŸ“± Testing Your Site

After deployment:
1. Visit your Netlify URL
2. Click "Show Tracking Settings" to test functionality  
3. Try clicking some cards
4. Check browser console (F12) to see tracking working

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

- **Use GitHub method** - it's easier and auto-deploys when you make changes
- **Custom domain** - You can add your own domain in Netlify settings
- **Environment variables** - Add any API keys in Netlify's Environment Variables section
